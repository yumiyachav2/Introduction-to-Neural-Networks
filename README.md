A paper that quickly introduces some of the key concepts in designing neural networks and analyses the impact of the user-defined parameters on the performance of the network.
The paper discusses the basic structure of a NN as well as some of the most commonly used elements and their purpose. The algorithms that run the network are clearly described and accompanied by equations.
The latter part of the papaer focuses on analysing the impact of learning rate, layer number, initial parameter distribution and other factors on the accuracy and efficiency of the network.
